# blackjack
This is a basic blackjack game.
It has a hit, stay, and double down interaction during the hand. You can change your bet in increments of 5. 
Double down doubles your current bet, up to your bank, gives you a card, then stands.

The dealer draws til they have a minimum of 17 or they're greater than you. 
Game ends when you've lost it all to your gambling addiction.<br/>

Future plans:
<ul>
  <li>Remake front end in React</li>
  <li>Add split</li>
  <li>Zhuzh up the visuals with wireframes and graphics from a UI designer friend</li>
</ul>
